# App Launching the introduction page
Online wheel search is not easy to use, and the flexibility is not high. Specially write a support for any customization. I always think that no matter how to refer to the effect of the APP on the market, it is impossible to imitate it. So the most important principle when writing some tool classes is that you can flexibly customize and give specific implementations to developers, so that they can do whatever they want. Like my other two libraries ([RollingNotice](https://github.com/maltsugar/RollingNotice), [CustomPopoverView](https://github.com/maltsugar/CustomPopoverView)), this principle is also the case. Doing small components will try to use this principle as the first standard, so that it is a "considered" library.

## This startup view first emulates a few typical typical effects. As for the effect, there is no effect, and you are completely free to play.


The way the material and video backgrounds are played is from [ZWIntroductionViewController] (https://github.com/squarezw/ZWIntroductionViewController), thanks to the author.
